# About

    protorpc is a very simple RPC implementation for Go and protobuf. It is
    not intended for production use at this time, but because it builds on
    the RPC implementation in the Go standard library as well as protobuf it
    should be easy to work out any bugs.

    protorpc is unrelated to any other Protocol Buffers RPC implementation
    and does not intend to be compatible in API or wire format with any other.

# Requirements

    Go - http://golang.org/doc/install.html
    protobuf - http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
    goprotobuf - http://code.google.com/p/goprotobuf/

# Installing

    goinstall github.com/eclark/protorpc

# How it works

    Included is an alternate compiler plugin for protoc, building on the one
    included with goprotobuf, that understands service descriptors in your
    proto file.  It writes out an interface for your service, as well as
    client methods to give you an easy, type safe wrapper around rpc.Call.

# Usage

    protoc --protorpc-go_out=. <input.proto>

    Output will be the same as goprotobuf's compiler, with the addition of
    the following for each service: one interface, one register function,
    one client struct, one New function which returns the client struct,
    and a method on the client struct for each method that the service
    defines.

    The best way to get started is to review the files in the example
    directory.
